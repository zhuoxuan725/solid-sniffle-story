Once upon a time, there was a bird lived in the forest. She never left that forest. After meeting with the old who have been to a lot of places. Her greatest wish in her life was traveling around the world. She decided to start her travels in Rome. She learned all about Ancient Roman history and saw the Colosseum. Then, the bird moved on to Egypt and saw the pyramids and the Sphinx. 
From Egypt she flew south to Madagascar. She explored the jungle and saw many different animals and beautiful sights. Then she decided to rest on a boat and see where it took her.
When the bird awoke, the boat had traveled all the way to South America. She flew around Brazil, and visited Rio. She enjoyed people watching the many people in the city. The bird then sat and remembered it's travels, happy with the experiences she enjoyed. After she went to all the places. She finally got to the forest where she used to live and told her story to the others there.
